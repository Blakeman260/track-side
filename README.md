This site is here to help the unexperienced and guide them on what to do and how to prepare themselves and their car, for a intense day of driving on the track. So this site’s aim is to help guide users on how to modify their cars, so they go from a standard car, to a car, that is more than capable of taking hours of abuse at a track and come out the other end alright. The shop with let users buy, only the best and tested products for their cars, with a forum full of other previous customers, telling you how it has helped their car. With us also offering a service, where we have track ready vehicles for sale, so the customer can buy the car, then take it out straight out onto the track, not having to spend any more money on the car, they can just jump in and drive. Or, if the customer is not quite 100% sure on ready to invest into a big hobby, they can also rent out a track car, for the day, to get a taste of the hobby and feel the excitement that driving around on the track gives you!

Emotional triggers
There is a big a excitement that people experience on track day sessions. An initial buzz, you can smell burning rubber and high octane content in the air, and once you get out on the track ,you just keep on smiling and enjoying yourself as you push yourself and try and better yourself from the previous lap that you’ve just done on the track. The website is wanting to tap into that emotion, giving customers the chance to offer better performance upgrades for their cars, making them handle, grip and perform better on their next track day. The site will also be offering this thrill, as for new comers, they’ll be offering the chance to rent a car, to try the experience for themselves, so they can get a taste of the thrill and how addictive it can be.

Structure
Theme
The theme is going to aim for Track day sessions, so a darkish black background (for the tarmac) with various banners having white surrounds (road markings), Orange for standout parts, like sales or offers (same colour as the traffic cones along the track side), Red writing – stands out, against the black, but again another colour considered on the track, as it’s seen with the tail lights. This is mainly for the shop. For the forum (TBC, but possibly called Track side forum) to have a green grass and black and white theme, similar colours you’d see pit side, spectating on others on the track, allowing you to talk to other drivers on their experience in the sport.

Priority :
The main aim of the website, is for users to be able to purchase products that they desire for their track car, the forum will give the users to see how the products sold have helped the other users on their track days, but main focus is the ability to buy products from the shop.
