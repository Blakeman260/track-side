### Content culture
Prominently aimed at people with a motoring hobby, people who already spend a lot of time, racing in their own time, or who are looking into doing so.

### Content relevant
It wants to be orientated around cars, mainly track ready cars and what’s the best way to prepare yours to be prepared and safe for a track day.

### Technology appropriate?
-	A shop where customers can purchase product

### Why is it special?
This tends to be a hobby, where people tend to know everything there is about it, or they know barely anything. The shop will let users buy, only the best and tested products for their cars. 

### Why would a user want this site?
A user would want this site, as it’ll be easy to buy the best and already tested products for their cars, the site can become a main source of help them throughout their hobby and supply them with the products that they require.

### Emotional triggers
There is a big a excitement that people experience on track day sessions. An initial buzz, you can smell burning rubber and high octane content in the air, and once you get out on the track ,you just keep on smiling and enjoying yourself as you push yourself and try and better yourself from the previous lap that you’ve just done on the track. The website is wanting to tap into that emotion, giving customers the chance to offer better performance upgrades for their cars, making them handle, grip and perform better on their next track day. 

### Scope
Features:
-	Online store for performance products
-	Social media links

### Priority :
The main aim of the website, is for users to be able to purchase products that they desire for their track car.

### Structure
Theme
The theme is going to aim for Track day sessions, so a darkish black background (for the tarmac) with various banners having white surrounds (road markings), Orange for standout parts, like sales or offers (same colour as the traffic cones along the track side), Red writing – stands out, against the black, but again another colour considered on the track, as it’s seen with the tail lights. This is mainly for the shop. For the forum (TBC, but possibly called Track side forum) to have a green grass and black and white theme, similar colours you’d see pit side, spectating on others on the track, allowing you to talk to other drivers on their experience in the sport.

This is how I originally intended for my website to look:

In the beginning, I wanted to include various other services within the website, including a forum, in which people could leave reviews on the products, so other users could see, along with renting and buying track cars.

This is how it actually looks:

After entering the shop, this is how I wanted it to be:

<img src="/media/Shop_Front.png" alt="Base page" style="max-width:100%;">

I also wanted to include picture links, but after toying with the idea, it wouldn't of worked very well on mobile views, so this is why I went for the menu choice below.

As you can see, this is what I opted for.

Now, as for the product listings, I did initially want it like this, but it didn't sit right for me as you'd only be able to see so many products at once, where as on the latest product list, you can see up to 4 products at once.

<img src="/media/Specified_car_product_list.png" alt="Base page" style="max-width:100%;">

As you can see, you can easily see 4 products, as well as the start of 4 below, leaving the customer to want to keep scrolling to see the other available products.

The actual product detail page didn't vary that much from the initial design, the only thing that wasn't included, was obviously the part about the reviews.
