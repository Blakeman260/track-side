Emotional triggers
There is a big a excitement that people experience on track day sessions. An initial buzz, you can smell burning rubber and high octane content in the air, and once you get out on the track ,you just keep on smiling and enjoying yourself as you push yourself and try and better yourself from the previous lap that you’ve just done on the track. The website is wanting to tap into that emotion, giving customers the chance to offer better performance upgrades for their cars, making them handle, grip and perform better on their next track day. 

Scope
Features:
-	Online store for performance products
-	Social media links

Structure
Theme
The theme is going to aim for Track day sessions, so a darkish black background (for the tarmac) with various banners having white surrounds (road markings), Orange for standout parts, like sales or offers (same colour as the traffic cones along the track side), Red writing – stands out, against the black, but again another colour considered on the track, as it’s seen with the tail lights. This is mainly for the shop. For the forum (TBC, but possibly called Track side forum) to have a green grass and black and white theme, similar colours you’d see pit side, spectating on others on the track, allowing you to talk to other drivers on their experience in the sport.

Priority :
The main aim of the website, is for users to be able to purchase products that they desire for their track car.
